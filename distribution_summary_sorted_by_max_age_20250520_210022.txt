EXPERT TEAM NOTES (Allocation based on Max Household Age)
------------------------------------------------------------
Barangay Captain (Kap. Rosalie Mauricio): Resources were allocated prioritizing
households with the eldest members first. Vulnerability factors like young children
and elderly members within those households were then considered for specific kit types.

Councilor for Distribution (Kgd. Romy Colubong): Distribution plan accounts for
household size for food packs, and specific needs (school supplies, medical kits)
after the primary sorting by max age.

Treas. (Weng Panganiban): The current allocation utilized a portion of the available budget for resource distribution.
